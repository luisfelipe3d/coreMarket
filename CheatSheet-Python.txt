Operators	Operation	Example
**	        Exponent	2 ** 3 = 8
%	        Modulus/Remaider	22 % 8 = 6
//	        Integer division	22 // 8 = 2
/	        Division	22 / 8 = 2.75
*	        Multiplication	3 * 3 = 9
-	        Subtraction	5 - 2 = 3

Boolean evaluation
Never use == or != operator to evaluate boolean operation. Use the is or is not operators, or use implicit boolean evaluation.

if name == 'Alice':
    print('Hi Alice')
elif age < 12:
    print('lalal')
else:
    print('bbb')

spam = 0
while spam < 5:
    print('hello')
    spam = spam + 1

while True:
    print('Please type your name.')
    name = input()
    if name == 'your name':
        break
print('Thank you!')


continue Statements
When the program execution reaches a continue statement, the program execution immediately jumps back to the start of the loop.

while True:
    print('Who are you?')
    name = input()
    if name != 'Joe':
        continue
    print('Hello, Joe. What is the password? (It is a fish.)')
    password = input()
    if password == 'swordfish':
        break
print('Access granted.')

>>> print('My name is')
>>> for i in range(5):
>>>     print('Jimmy Five Times ({})'.format(str(i)))
My name is
Jimmy Five Times (0)
Jimmy Five Times (1)
Jimmy Five Times (2)
Jimmy Five Times (3)
Jimmy Five Times (4)
